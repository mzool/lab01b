 <p> Getting started
To make sure you work all the chest muscles, include a mix of motions in your chest workout routine:
Press using the flat or incline bench, dumbbells, or bar, or seated machine chest press.
Lift using the parallel bars, floor, or bench.
Pull using the cable fly bench, dumbbells, or cable crossovers.
If you’re a beginner, meet with a trainer to make sure you are following a good program with proper form during the exercises. Consider starting with a lower weight to reduce your risk of injury. You should be able to pick up the weight without too much strain. Remember, you can always go up in weight if the exercise seems too easy.
The number of reps and sets you do depends on your goal:
To increase size, try 1 to 3 sets of 8-12 reps for new or intermediate lifters or 3-6 sets of 1-12 reps for seasoned lifters, of a weight that is at the higher end of your 1 rep max. Rest 1-2 minutes with more reps and up to 3 minutes for higher weight, lower rep sets.
To increase strength, try 1 to 3 sets of 8-12 reps for new or intermediate lifters or 2-6 sets of 1-8 reps for seasoned lifters, of a weight that is around 60-80 percent of your max, depending on your experience. Rest 1-2 minutes with more reps and up to 3 minutes for higher weight, lower rep sets.

<h1 id="head3">3. Bent forward cable crossover</h1>
<h3 id="head4">Equipment needed: high pulley machine</h3>
<h3>1-Begin this exercise either with your feet planted hip-width apart, or with one in front of the other as if you are walking.</h3>
<h3>2-Grasp the pulley handles with your arms straight out and facing inward, making sure that your hands are below your shoulders and your elbows are bent a bit.</h3>
<h3>3-Make your movements slow and controlled — no jerking — as you bring your hands together and extend your arms. For a wider arc and more resistance, move your arms down first and then in toward each other to cross one hand over</h3>
<h3>4-Bring your arms slowly back to the starting position with control. Don’t let your arms go back past the shoulders.</h3>
